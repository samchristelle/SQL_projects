# Project Background
This project analyzes global forest share data to uncover trends in forest cover change from 2000 to 2020. The goal is to identify countries and regions that have seen significant increases or decreases in forest area, and explore how geopolitical groupings (e.g., UN membership) relate to these changes.

# Data Collection & Preparation
-Source Dataset: Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/deforestation-dataset) â€“ includes forest share in 2000 and 2020 for each country.
-Country Names: Added to Excel file using [IBAN Country Codes.](https://www.iban.com/country-codes)
-Continent & UN Membership Info: Added using data from [World Population Review.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/list-of-countries-by-continent)

## Data Cleaning:
-Removed entries with zero values for forest share.
-Standardized column names and formats in Excel for analysis in SQL.

# Key Questions & Objectives
--What are the top 10 countries that saw the largest increase in forest share from 2000 to 2020?--
Purpose: Identify global leaders in forest growth and conservation.

--What are the top 10 countries that saw the largest decrease in forest share from 2000 to 2020?--
Purpose: Highlight countries facing significant deforestation challenges.

--What is the average change in forest share per continent between 2000 and 2020?--
Purpose: Understand regional trends in forest cover change.

--How do UN member countries compare to non-members in terms of forest share change?--
Purpose: Explore if UN affiliation is associated with better forest management.

--Which UN member nations experienced an increase in forest share of at least 30 percentage points?--
Purpose: Identify countries with substantial progress in reforestation efforts.
