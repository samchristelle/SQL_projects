# Forest Share Change Analysis (2000–2020)

Between 2000 and 2020, forest share across countries varied widely, with some making remarkable gains while others experienced significant losses.

The top ten countries that saw the largest increase in forest share include Guernsey, Bahrain, Iceland, Djibouti, Uruguay, Burundi, Cuba, Kuwait, Montenegro, and Malta. Among these, three nations—Guernsey, Iceland, and Malta—are located in Europe. Notably, Europe was the only continent to record a net increase in forest share over the two decades, with a 1.60% rise in 2020 compared to 2000.

Guernsey led globally with an impressive 86.2% increase in forest share. This growth can be largely attributed to community-driven reforestation efforts, particularly through organizations such as [Guernsey Trees For Life (GTFL)](https://www.gtfl.earth/). GTFL has played a key role in promoting sustainable land use by organizing rural and urban tree planting, educational programs in schools, and public tree walks to engage local residents.

On the other hand, the ten countries with the largest decrease in forest share were Egypt, Côte d'Ivoire, Nicaragua, Gambia, Chad, Paraguay, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Malawi, Uganda, and Cambodia. Six of these countries are located in Africa, which experienced a significant regional decline—losing 2.58% of its forest share during the same period. Egypt's complete loss of forest share (100%) is largely attributed to rapid urbanization, which has led to the removal of trees and vegetation to make way for infrastructure such as roads.

When comparing UN member and non-member countries, membership appeared to have minimal impact on forest cover trends. UN member states recorded an average forest share decline of 0.80%, while non-members saw a slightly smaller decrease of 0.12%. Despite this general downward trend, many of the countries with the most substantial increases in forest share—including Bahrain, Iceland, and Djibouti—are UN members and reported gains of over 50%.

Bahrain, for instance, achieved an 80% increase in forest share by 2020. The country launched an ambitious [afforestation initiative](https://www.bahrain.bh/wps/portal/en/BNP/HomeNationalPortal/ContentDetailsPage/!ut/p/z1/nZNdT8IwFIb_yrzgculZN7rucop8mBgQNpDdkG4rUGGncxYUf73DqAniF567Ju-bPD19ShJySxIUW7UQRmkU6_o8TdjM6TWhyy8ABi2Pws04GLLzaweuOy6ZHAacKIY60AuH_XbLAc8hyV_68M2E8Lf-RyCIAgaM0tCjo44L_VP7x4HkZ7wxSUhSZionU55RCvNM2IH0ue3R1LcFS8H2cur4WcA5S919OkNTmiWZpljOJDZApHpjLLOU1krhItdFAyRuVaWxkGgsgbmFwmwq2YBKroWRuWV0qbKHBjzLSlsoN6YSa2V25Orwul0WUWBhx3cHg0unf-7u31Pd3d8nYY2h0cgnQ25_4JgrFJjJd4ZXJyxZN3WxO6Z5q1npJl9I8xnmeLUnwvx3KZP90g8kieM2MN5pex7jQ7_pfw58YfFvHkxrj_xvL9urRdsq-Uhi1FVR_6vRidp0gYwkkrKI6ym421xvi4m9GvLHaL4Iz14A5_HCeg!!/) in 2022, aiming to restore and expand green cover as part of its broader strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
